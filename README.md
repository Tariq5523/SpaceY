# SpaceY 
This repository is for a project called SpaceY. SpaceY is fake startup company that competes with SpaceX with the aim of decreasing the cost of landing the first stage of a rocket. 


Project Backgorund:

Space X advertises Falcon 9 rocket launches on its website with a cost of 62 million dollars; other providers cost upward of 165 million dollars each, much of the savings is because Space X can reuse the first stage. Therefore, if we can determine if the first stage will land, we can determine the cost of a launch. This information can be used if an alternate company wants to bid against space X for a rocket launch. The goal of the project is to create a machine learning pipeline to predict if the first stage will land successfully.![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/87971695/223581787-dee9ca02-c1a8-4d8e-92e9-66e9fe731c35.png)

Questions to answer:
- What factors determine if the rocket will land successfully?

- The interaction amongst various features that determine the success rate of a successful landing.

- What operating conditions needs to be in place to ensure a successful landing program?
